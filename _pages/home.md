## Welcome Young Professionals!

IEEE UK & Ireland (UK&I) Young Professionals is an Affinity Group for electrical, electronics, software and computer systems engineers that have graduated in the last decade. IEEE UK&I YP a professional network that assists with transitioning from university into the professional world.

## Mission

### Creating a global network of young professionals
Increase your reach and network

IEEE UK&I YP has a very wide reach with over 6,000 members and as the name suggests covers England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Ireland. Like many other affiliate groups, IEEE UK&I YP places a strong focus on the three main areas of the IEEE, namely social networking, professional development and enhancement of technical skills. Our aim is to organise a variety of technical events including site visits, technical workshops and seminars and non-technical events including project management, leadership and communication skills workshops, along with social events to foster professional awareness in a structured yet lively environment that address membersâ€™ concerns and meet their needs. These events are often open to members (of all grades) as well as non-members.

## Vision
### Networking and Career Development
The first fifteen years after graduation from university can be challenging for Young Professionals (YP). Employment searches, new jobs, professional growth, career development, and life status changes are common experiences for many recent graduates. We envisage to improve the technical and leadership skills of our members while also providing a forum for professional networking. An important part of running any successful event is ensuring the attendance of members and getting the word out there. The UK&I YP intends to use both email and social media to communicate with and encourage attendance of members. As much as hosting our own events, we welcome active collaboration with other similar organisations in the region for joint events of mutual benefit as well as support from industry to fund events or promote products or services.

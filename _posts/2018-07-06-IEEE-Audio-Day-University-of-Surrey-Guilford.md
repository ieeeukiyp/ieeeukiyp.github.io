YP participated in this one-day event on 6th July 2018 at University of
Surrey, Guildford focussed on bringing together researchers and
collaborators engaged in audio-related research projects including
musical audio repurposing using source separation; spatial audio in the
home; making sense of sounds; and creative commons audio. Many of these
are collaborative projects, including members of the Centre for Vision,
Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP), Institute of Sound Recording
(IoSR), Digital World Research Centre (DWRC) and Centre for Digital
Economy (CoDE).

YP assisted the Signal Processing Chapter promote the event and hosted a
session on 'Young Professionals' accompanied by a stall at the trade
fair. Further details can be found here

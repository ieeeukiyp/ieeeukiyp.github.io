IEEE UK & Ireland Young Professionals and the University of Leeds IEEE Student Branch cordially invite you to the 2nd postgraduate research STEM symposium.

This **FREE ONE DAY** symposium is an opportunity for early career STEM researchers, especially PGRs (PhD and MPhil), to present their research, receive feedback, and explore the possibilities of turning research to enterprise.

The symposium is open to research professionals and students across the country and beyond and we are now accepting submissions of abstracts of research work for oral/poster presentation. ONLY abstract submission is required for the oral presentation. Poster presenters will be required to print and come along with their posters. **The deadline for abstract submissions is 23rd September 2019 and free registration is OPEN UNTIL 6th October 2019.**

## Symposium Features

The event focuses on research, enterprise and knowledge transfer and will comprise of keynote talks, presentations (of submitted abstracts), panel discussion, workshops, awards and a networking dinner.

**Keynotes**: Learn from notable experts and entrepreneurs as they deliver [keynote](https://edu.ieee.org/uk-leeds/stem-symposium/symposium-keynotes-and-panellists/)  talks on various business related STEM topics.

**Presentations**: Participants are invited to [submit](https://forms.gle/meeDaTgScAXGPQuu5) abstracts of their research for oral/poster presentation at the symposium. The submissions will be classified and presented through different tracks. This is not a peer reviewed conference – the idea here is to give participants the opportunity to discuss their research before an unfamiliar audience and get feedback which will help them improve their work for subsequent presentations. A poster session will allow participants to interact with different researchers on their displayed research topics.

**Workshops**: In intensive skills sessions, experts will deliver [workshops](https://edu.ieee.org/uk-leeds/symposium-workshops/)  on “How to give a technical presentation” and “How to write research fellowship applications”.

**Panel Discussion**: An open panel discussion session that allows panelists to briefly introduce/discuss their outlined focus areas and to field questions from the participants and share their experiences and perspectives related to their journeys to their current careers. Focus will include:

-  Pathways to industry
-  Pathways to academia
-  Becoming an entrepreneur
-  Professional registration
-  Benefits of professional body membership
-  Starting MPhil/PhD (by a fresh MPhil/PhD student)
-  Finishing MPhil/PhD (by an MPhil/PhD student in their final stages)

**Awards**: The IEEE UK & Ireland Young Professionals is sponsoring awards for “Best Oral Presentation” and “Best Poster Presentation”.

**Networking Dinner**: A chance to network with symposium attendees and speakers over a 3-course dinner. Participants who choose to attend the networking dinner will pay a fee of about £15.00 to the restaurant. Indicate your interest at registration.

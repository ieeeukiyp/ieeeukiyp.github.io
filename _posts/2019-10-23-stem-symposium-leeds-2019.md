This **FREE ONE DAY** symposium is an opportunity for early career STEM researchers, especially PGRs (PhD and MPhil), to present their research, receive feedback, and explore the possibilities of turning research to enterprise.

The symposium is open to research professionals and students across the country and beyond and we are now accepting submissions of abstracts of research work for oral/poster presentation. ONLY abstract submission is required for the oral presentation. Poster presenters will be required to print and come along with their posters. **The deadline for abstract submissions is 23rd September 2019 and free registration is OPEN UNTIL 6th October 2019.**

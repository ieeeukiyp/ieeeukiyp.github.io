The YP Postgraduate STEM Research Symposium is single day event that
gives opportunity to early STEM researchers, especially PGRs (PhD and
MPhil), to present their research, receive feedback, and explore the
possibilities of turning research to enterprise. The symposium is open
to professionals and students and accepts abstracts submissions for
posters and oral presenters. The [first
edition](https://ieeeukiyp.org/previous-events/2018/11/28/first-stem-research-symposium.html)
of the symposium was hosted by the Department of Computer Science,
University of Chester. During the day, the attendees (both IEEE and
non-IEEE members) participated in interactive workshops, oral & poster
presentations, and an open-panel discussion.

# The Postgraduate STEM Research Symposium

The second edition of the YP Postgraduate STEM Research Symposium held
at the University of Leeds, UK. It was organised by the IEEE UK &
Ireland Young Professionals, in collaboration with the University of
Leeds IEEE Student Branch on 23 October 2019. The symposium was well
attended by over 65 participants (23 IEEE and 42 non-IEEE members)
including post-graduate researchers, and established professionals from
the academia and industry. A total of 39 abstract submissions were
received.

After collecting their symposium pack at the registration desk, attendees
networked as they had welcome coffee. The morning session of the event began
with welcome talks by the Head of School, School of Electronic & Electrical
Engineering (Prof Robert Kelsall) and Chair of the IEEE Aerospace and System
Society (AESS) for United Kingdom & Ireland (Dr Matt Ritchie). Thereafter, a
keynote speaker of the Symposium (Prof Mike Hinchey, Chair of IEEE UK &
Ireland Section) gave a talk on "building resilient space exploration
missions" that elicited several interactive discussions. After networking
during a short coffee/tea break, the morning session of the symposium
concluded with oral presentations by the first group of postgraduate STEM
researchers. Lunch was served around noon in parallel with a poster
presentation session where postgraduate STEM researchers networked and
discussed their research with symposium attendees in a professional setting.

The afternoon session of the symposium began with a second keynote talk
by Prof Peter Jimack (Director of the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training
in Fluid Dynamics) entitled "Efficient numerical algorithms for the
solution of fluid dynamics problems". The keynote talk was followed by
two engaging and educative workshop sessions on "How to give a technical
presentation" and "How to write research fellowship applications"
facilitated by reputable academics (Prof Mohsen Razai and Prof Christoph
Walti) from the University of Leeds. The workshop session was followed
by another tea & coffee break which provided further networking
opportunities and another chance to evaluate the symposium's poster
presentations.

The evening session of the symposium began with the final interactive
keynote talk by Eric Hawthorn (Executive Chairman, Radio Design Ltd)
entitled "Cellular Radio -- Business & Technology". Oral presentation by
a second group of postgraduate STEM researchers followed the keynote
talk. A knowledge sharing interactive panel discussion on increasing
impact of academic activities on industry followed the second oral
presentation session. The panel discussion had been put together to
cover a broad range of topics, snapping academic opportunities,
start-ups, entrepreneurship, fellowships and development in
technologies. The session was chaired by Prof Ian Hunter. The panel
comprise of experienced professionals from industry and academia
including Dr Sarah Fores, Eric Hawthorn, Prof Christoph Walti, Prof
Peter Jimack, and Prof Robert Kelsall. The panel discussion was
interactive allowing panellists to share their experience and wisdom and
counsel with the next generation of researchers and entrepreneurs. The
panel comprise of experienced professionals from industry and academia.
Panellists also responded to questions from symposium attendees in the
interactive panel discussion.

and "Best Poster Presentation" at the STEM Symposium. Simon Obute's oral
presentation entitled "RepAtt: Achieving Swarm Coordination through
Chemotaxis" won the award for the best oral presentation. Eleanor
Nuttall's and Kieran Bull's poster presentations entitled "Terahertz
Lasers: New Techniques for Studying the Chemistry of Climate Change" and
"Systematic construction of scarred many-body dynamics in 1D lattice
models" respectively both won the awards for best poster presentation. A
post-symposium dinner provided further networking opportunity for
pre-registered symposium attendees, speakers and organising committee
members.

# The Role of IEEE UK and Ireland Young Professionals (YP)

The YP affinity group was the main sponsor of the event. This is because
supporting Postgraduate STEM Researchers to develop necessary research
and presentation skill is one of our priorities as an affinity group.
The symposium held at the University of Leeds is one of such events that
promotes interaction between young professionals (STEM researchers) and
experienced academia and industrial professionals to help the younger
professionals develop skills and strategies to excel in their research
degrees and future careers.

IEEE YP UK & Ireland will continue to deliver to the community of young
people with similar events, while building diverse professional
networks. We are glad to make the second edition of the Postgraduate
STEM Symposium happen along with our co-organiser, the University of
Leeds IEEE Student Branch. Members of local organizing committee (at the
University of Leeds) includes but is not limited to Dr Mustafa Bakr,
Opeyemi Ajibola, Azza Eltraify, Li Lei, Nikollao Sulollari and Mansourah
Aljohani. The YP's effort was led by the vice chair, Dr Thaddeus Eze
with active support from the chair, Mr Noel Gomes and other YP
volunteers (Mr Opeyemi Ajibola, Dr Moises Jezzini and Dr Mortaza
Doulaty). All volunteers participated in the planning of the symposium.

The symposium committee also received strong support from the School of
Electronic and Electrical Engineering who facilitated free access to the
symposium venues, facilities used at the University of Leeds, and
assigned faculty members to act as advisors supporting the symposium
planning (Prof Ian Hunter, Prof Mohsen Razavi, and Clair Atkinson). In
addition, several faculty members at the University of Leeds including
but not limited to Prof Ian Hunter, Prof Peter Jimack, Prof Robert
Kelsall, Dr Sarah Fores, Prof Mohsen Razavi Prof Christoph Wälti
actively participated in the symposium by giving welcome addresses,
keynote talks, workshops and joining the panel discussion session. Eric
Hawthorn the Executive Chairman of Radio Design LTD also supported the
symposium by giving a keynote talk and attending all session of the
symposium. Eric also sponsored drinks for all participants at the
networking dinner the concluded the symposium.

The symposium committee were also supported by IEEE UK & Ireland
Section. Prof Mike Hinchey (Chair, IEEE UK & Ireland Section) gave a
keynote talk at the symposium. During the planning stages the Section
also helped with publicity of event through their website and eNotice
messages.

# The Impact of the Event

The feedbacks from the event attendees were encouraging. Some of the
participants hadn't heard about the IEEE, the University of Leeds IEEE
Student Branch and the IEEE YP affinity group before and we seized the
opportunity to introduce IEEE and its benefits to a good number of them.
By the end of the event, four participants showed interest to join the
University of Leeds IEEE Student Branch.

With events like this, we are hoping that more enthusiasts will join our
team, as members and volunteers to further our goals and commitment to
our members. We hope to build on the success of the second edition of
the Postgraduate STEM Research Symposium next year by hosting the third
edition of the symposium. Check

# Support

The symposium was approved and supported by the IEEE UK and Ireland
Section. The symposium secured \$400 funding from the Student
Professional Awareness Activities (SPAAs) and \$1000 from the IEEE
Aerospace and System Society (AESS) to support the symposium. The IEEE
Communications Society (ComSoc) Chapter UK and Ireland sponsored the
prizes awarded for best oral and poster presentations with £300. The
University of Leeds sponsored an additional award for best poster
presentation with £100 and provided material support, including free
venue and poster holders.

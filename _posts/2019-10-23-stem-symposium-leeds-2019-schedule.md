**Autonomous navigation of a mobile robot using a Histogram filter**
The model presented in this work illustrates the performance of a
probabilistic filtering algorithm for the autonomous navigation of a
mobile robot in a structured environment. We selected a grid-based
application of Bayes’ filter, the histogram filter, for the study. A
mobile robot needs to understand its present location, where the goal
is, and how it can reach the goal to achieve autonomous navigation. The
problem of localization comes first, followed by path planning and
navigation. Our model uses a histogram filter to localize the robot in a
closed environment, and later perform path planning through dynamic
programming to navigate to a target location. The histogram filter
discretizes the robot’s world into a grid-world setting and assigns a
probability value to each cell. We preferred the odometry motion model
to the velocity motion model in calculating the robot’s motion over
time. Though both models suffer from drift, odometry model is generally
more accurate. We selected a Pioneer 3DX mobile robot as the test bed
owing to its robustness in performing autonomous navigation tasks. The
results of the experiment presented in this paper using MobileSim and
the real robot validates the accuracy of the proposed model.

**EEG signal processing with a smart model-based tting: a comparison with traditional methods**
Electroencephalography is a safe recording of brain activity, used in
clinical and non-clinical purposes. Extracting meaningful information
from EEG poses significant challenges for digital processing due to
non-stationary behaviour and a very small Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Such
challenges have become particularly important with wearable EEGs, used
without clinical supervision. They are more sensitive to noises and are
generally less accurate than clinical devices. A quantitative evaluation
of the measurement uncertainty is essential to understand the
acquisition reliability. A good signal processing must achieve two
objectives: 1) work without changing the original shape and information
of the raw signals avoiding the risk of a wrong interpretation; 2)
continuously and automatically assess the uncertainty of any quantity
estimated from the signals. Some benefits are a decreased risk of wrong
classification and an improvement for feature selection and extraction,
especially for a dynamic system. This can be achieved by using available
'a priori' knowledge about signals (frequency band and dynamics of
amplitude and phase modulations) to implement a model-based fitting
process able to follow the time evolution of specific brain waves,
estimating its uncertainty and reliability simultaneously. This model
works as automatic smart filtering, with better performance than common
signal processing methods in the time domain (band-pass filtering) or
frequency domain (Fourier Transform).

**The breakage of elongated particles for agitated drying conditions in the pharmaceutical industry**
Crystal breakage is an issue of great concern to the pharmaceutical
industry. Conservation of the desired Particle Size Distribution (PSD)
throughout downstream processing is extremely important, as PSD changes
are known to affect properties such as bulk density, solubility and
flowability. Active pharmaceutical ingredients are in majority organic
and their crystal shape of high aspect ratio; their main breakage
mechanism is fragmentation by bending. To elucidate the fracture
phenomenon of elongated particles in agitated drying, the bending stress
of individual crystals needs to be determined within a bed of particles.
In this study, a shear cell is built in Discrete Element Method and
mimics the stress experienced by particles in dryers using moving
parallel plates and periodic boundaries. Elongated rigid particles are
modelled with clumped spheres and experience stress due to the shear
application in the box. The bending stress of individual particles is
calculated during the simulation and a bending stress distribution is
obtained for the given stress condition (normal and shear). The bending
stress distribution is combined with the experimental breakage strength
distribution of Beta-Glutamic Acid crystals, allowing the estimation of
the extent of breakage within the particle bed during the shearing
phase. The extent of breakage is found to increase exponentially with
the hydrostatic pressure for agitated drying conditions in the
pharmaceutical industry.

**Tele-Sex: Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications**
There is growing interest in utilising IoT and haptic technology for
intimate communication. Specifically, where two devices are networked
with sensors and effectors which enable intimate interaction and
communication. This has flourished since the expiration of the patent
for the \`\`method and device for interactive virtual control of sexual
aids using digital computer networks'' (U.S. Patent No. 6,368,268.),
otherwise known as the teledildonics patent. However, this application
is rife with privacy, security, and ethical challenges, which are
confounded by a general lack of research in this specific domain. This
review provides a map of the current research engagement and identifies
and illustrates some of the potential risks (with some historical
context), and an exploration of the future implications of this
technology. The range of possible benefits and drawbacks in regard to
this technology are varied, highlighting the need for transdisciplinary
engagement. We conclude with a number of insights, and a call to arms
for further research.

**Decarbonisation of heat: a heat pump load shifting model**
The UK has now committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net
zero by 2050. To do so requires significant progress to be made in the
heating sector, which accounts for a quarter of overall emissions. Heat
demands are highly variable, reaching huge peaks during and hourly ramp
rates during winter. The natural gas network can currently cope with
this variability, but a range of solutions will be required to
transition to a low carbon system. Electrification of heating, using
heat pumps, is one attractive option due to the significant progress in
decarbonising electricity generation. Concerns remain, however, over
impacts that widespread uptake could have on peak electricity demands,
particularly on the distribution network level. In this study the
operation of a heat pump and thermal storage system has been optimised
to minimise costs using a variable electricity tariff that discourages
peak electricity usage. The potential peak demand reduction has been
quantified and a comparison has been made between the building material
and thermal storage unit in shifting usage. Results indicate that
building thermal mass and therefore heat pump scheduling plays a
significant role in shifting electrical load to off peak times.

**Development of improved second-generation of the Automated Solar Activity Prediction system (ASAP)**
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in real-time
processing of solar data, especially for space weather applications.
Solar flare prediction has become a forefront topic because extreme
solar eruptions could affect our daily life activities. Therefore, the
main goal of this paper is to develop a new prediction algorithm based
on the Automated Solar Activity Prediction system (ASAP) system. The
proposed algorithm updates the ASAP system by extending the training
process and optimizing the learning rules to create better optimization
for the performance. Two neural networks are used in the proposed
system. The first neural network is used to predict whether a certain
sunspot class at a certain time is likely to produce a significant flare
or not. The second neural network is used to predict the type of this
flare, X or M-class. Some measurement criteria are applied to determine
the extent of system performance and all results are provided in this
paper. The results exhibit that the proposed algorithm outperforms the
old ASAP system.

**Techno-Economic Analysis of Li-ion Batteries in the Capacity Market with Different Degradation Models**
Increased deployment of intermittent renewable energy plants raises
concerns about energy security. Capacity markets (CM) have been
implemented to secure energy generation and provide energy affordability
for customers. This paper contributes to answering the question of
whether batteries can provide cost effective back up services in this
market. It improves on earlier research in the field by considering
battery degradation and capacity market de-rating factors. To provide a
comprehensive techno-economic analysis, three lithium ion battery
degradation models with different complexity were utilised. The results
demonstrated that degradation cost can significantly impact the
potential profit from each battery and the battery with the 1h de-rating
factor shows the highest revenue within the current CM regulations. The
empirical degradation model is simple but overestimate the capacity loss
especially in the first cycles. Keeping the temperature at 5ºC and at
low SoC (20%) offers the highest profit. In contrast, the semi-empirical
model shows that the degradation cost is maximum at 5ºC and minimal at
25ºC with SoC (20%). The physics model offers a deeper understanding for
the complex degradation mechanisms inside the battery and it shows that
minimum degradation is at 5ºC in storing condition. While CM rules
require batteries to remain ready to respond at system stress events,
the results suggest that large losses are anticipated if batteries are
kept at 100% state of charge.

**Can event-driven micro-services be ameliorated through performance feedback from performance data?**
When an event-driven micro-service is created there is often less
emphasis into performance testing or monitoring it as testing isn’t
straightforward and proves to be very time consuming. This may result in
errors and difficulties later in the lifecycle of the event-driven
microservice as it scales. Performance testing should be a necessity
when developing a microservice, but unfortunately it does not often
happen unless a serious complication arises further in the event-driven
lifecycle, this will take up more time, energy and cost than doing it at
the start of the deployment lifecycle. Each service in a microservice
may have its own dependencies, some direct, others transitive and each
service could connect to its one or more databases such as Mongodb and
MySQL. Establishing a valid record of these dependencies for each
service is difficult to maintain, requiring a dedicated team to monitor
each service inside the microservice. Whether it’s database errors,
network latency, caching issues, or service unavailability, event-driven
microservices should be able to handle a reasonable level of faults.
Performance testing highlights defects and performance issues in the
event-driven microservice early and ultimately will help curb these
issues before going into a production environment. The aim of this paper
is to inform development teams and DevOps engineers about managing their
performance testing within microservices. Using specific tools to test
different aspects of performance testing such as Load testing and
resilience testing will ultimately create a more fault tolerant
microservices from the evidence collected through the means of
performance testing to create a tangible and adaptable framework.

**A Meta-Analysis for Evaluating the Efficacy of Different BCI Designs
for Upper Limb Stroke Rehabilitation** Recently brain-computer interface (BCI) has attracted increasing
attention as a potential tool for post-stroke upper limb rehabilitation.
Nevertheless, different BCI designs, used in clinical trials, stated
different clinical outcomes. The mechanism and efficiency of BCI for
stroke rehabilitation generally remains unclear, and it could be hard to
conclude the effective BCI paradigms for upper limb stroke
rehabilitation. In this Line, we present for the first time a
comprehensive meta-analysis to evaluate the short-term and long-term
efficacy of BCI for the hemiparetic stroke rehabilitation, as well as
the efficacy of different aspects of the BCI design according to the
type of performed mental tasks, applied neural classification features,
and feedback mechanism given to patients. Out of 587 studies, 11 studies
matching the inclusion criteria were found. The upper limb Fugl-Meyer
Assessment (FMA-UE) scores from the selected randomized control trials
(RCTs) were pooled, and the overall effect sizes were estimated. In
summary, our results support the use of band power feature,
neuromuscular electrical stimulation and the intention of movement in
the future BCI design for the upper limb post-stroke rehabilitation.
However, this conclusion should be taken carefully since our sample size
was relatively small and the heterogeneity between the selected RCTs
studies.

**New Chemical Processing and Recycling Technologies for
Auto-catalysts** The purpose of this research project is to develop a method to recycle
ceramic fibre. The ceramic fibre to be investigated is from catalytic
converters. The current methodology involves the characterisation of the
feed ceramic material, this will establish a suitable composition to
investigate further, such as; recovering of aluminium, silicon,
magnesium, calcium compounds from the large quantity of ceramic
material. And lastly, to validate the promising evidence gathered from
the Bayer process principles. An examination of several samples of the
ceramic insulation fibre revealed that reduced particle size of milled
ceramic fibre is more powerful than the particle size of unmilled
ceramic fibre, the milled particles are more exposed and has more
chances for individual coverage and also has a higher possibility for
the solvent and particulate matter to respond. The effects of metal
dissolution do not have a significant impact with the results of the
samples of ceramic insulation fibre, even no string device was
integrated into the design of the apparatus for both acid and alkali
digestion experiment. The particle size was determined by the use of SEM
analytical technique. In addition to this, the autoclaving time is also
varied, by contrasting two sets of time; 24 hours versus 72 hours. As no
drastic change observed between two sets of time, further analysis was
made with 24 hours due to it being more economical. The Carbolite Gero
oven with hydrothermal autoclave was used as a conventional heating at
120°C. The sulphuric acid precipitation with 10M NaOH shows a good
crystalline state. The determination of the chemical compounds’ quantity
is underway. The use of the three experimental techniques such as; XRPD,
ICP, EDS, suggests the presence of the Zeolites (NaAlSi2O6-H2O).
Currently the proposal scheme is still in its novelty. The future
success of the project depends on quantity recovered, how pure it is,
and the available market for the products recovered.

**On handling difficult dynamics with Predictive Functional Control** Predictive Functional Control (PFC) offers numerous advantages such as
trivial coding, easier implementation and simpler handling without
requiring sophisticated knowledge or specialised personnel. Besides
systematic handling of input and output constraints as well as process
dead-times makes PFC a preferred control strategy over more conventional
techniques, say PID, backed with many successful industrial
applications. PFC, arguably, belongs to the simplest branch of
model-based predictive control (MBPC) family wherein the principal
design is based on some rather simplistic assumptions, for instance,
plant output behaving like first-order dynamics, and the manipulated
variable being fixed within prediction horizon. Although the resulting
control law may not be optimal, but it is effective enough for
satisfactory closed-loop performance and that too without requiring
computationally expensive algorithms. Nevertheless, these
simplifications render PFC ineffective in applications when challenging
dynamics, such as open-loop instability or significant under-damping,
are prevalent. Obviously, the problem is with constant input, which
lacks flexibility to cope with divergent or unsettled predictions and
simultaneously provide smooth set-point tracking. Reported modifications
usually parametrise input to overcome unwanted dynamics, but at the
price of increased cost and coding complexity. A less common alternative
is the use of explicit pre-stabilisation or pre-conditioning loops that
may provide smooth and settled prediction behaviour. This talk presents
two pre-compensation methods namely compensation via (i) pole shifting
and, (ii) pole cancellation, and discusses their advantages and
disadvantages with regards to set point tracking, constraints management
and handling of external perturbations such as input and output
disturbance, sensor noise and model uncertainties. The work is pretty
much in initial stages and the presenter would highly appreciate
constructive feedback in this regard.

**RepAtt: Achieving Swarm Coordination through Chemotaxis** Swarm foraging is a common test case application for multi-robot
systems. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for improving
coordination of a robot swarm by selectively broadcasting repulsion and
attraction signals. Robots use a chemotaxis-inspired search behaviour
based on the temporal gradients of these signals in order to navigate
towards more advantageous areas. Hardware experiments were used to model
and validate realistic, noisy sound communication. We then show through
extensive simulation studies that our chemotaxis-based coordination
algorithm significantly improves swarm effectiveness when performing a
foraging task. A maximum reduction in foraging time of 83% was achieved
in one world configuration.

**Enhancing Topic Modeling for Quran Using Paragraph Vectors** Having a good representation of short text like Quran can benefit the
semantic understanding and inferring coherent topics. The Quran has been
the subject of numerous studies due to its linguistic and spiritual
value. Scholars have studied Quran for its topics. They have drawn out
knowledge that was the base for many applications to allow search in the
holy book. Many studies were devoted to topic modelling with the Quran.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation was mainly adopted in these works. However,
they were limited to a unigram model. Most research projects focused on
the translation of the Quran in different languages instead of the
original text. In my work, I use the original text of the Quran.
Besides, I explore using verses of the Quran as the input for the topic
modelling algorithm. Analysing a text like the Quran requires learning
approaches that go beyond word level to achieve phrase or sentence level
representation. So, in this work, I explore using paragraph vectors to
learn vector representations of Quranic Verses. These vectors can be
used as features and leveraged for the topic analysis. I then test
Paragraph vectors on the task of finding related verses of the Quran. I
have observed that verses that have a high probability under the same
topics tend to be highly semantically related to each other. The
positive results confirm that having good representations for texts can
promote its understanding and locate the semantically related verses
under the same topic.

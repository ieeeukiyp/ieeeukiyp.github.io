Professor Hinchey holds a B.Sc. in Computer Systems from University of Limerick, an M.Sc. in Computation from University of Oxford and a PhD in Computer Science from University of Cambridge. Professor Hinchey is a Chartered Engineer, Chartered Engineering Professional, Chartered Mathematician and Charted Information Technology Professional, as well as a Fellow of the IET, British Computer Society and Irish Computer Society. He is Editor-in-Chief of Innovations in Systems and Software Engineering: a NASA Journal and Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society. In January 2018, he became an Honorary Fellow of the Computer Society of India.

### Prof. Peter Jimack - Executive Dean, Faculty of Engineering, University of Leeds
**EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Fluid Dynamics**

#### Efficient numerical algorithms for the solution of fluid dynamics problems

In this talk I will introduce a number of key concepts that allow fast and efficient computational solution of systems of partial differential equations (PDEs). Such systems are used to model a wide range of physical phenomena, such as fluid flows, phase change problems and fluid-structure interactions.

The concepts that I will describe will include mesh-based schemes such as finite differences and finite elements, adaptive methods, multilevel solvers and parallel algorithms. These will be briefly explained and then their effectiveness across a selection of challenging application problems will be demonstrated.

The presentation will draw upon the work of a number of recent PhD students and collaborations with colleagues across the University.

#### About the speaker

Peter Jimack is Professor of Scientific Computing in the School of Computing at the University of Leeds. He has worked at Leeds since 1990, when he was initially appointed as a Lecturer in Mathematical Software. He was promoted to Associate Professor in 1997 and to Full Professor in 2003. Between 2010 and 2019 Peter served at the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering including, from 2015 to 2019, as a member of the University Executive. Prior to this he was pro-Dean for Research in the Faculty of Engineering from 2007 to 2010.

Peter’s research is on the development, analysis and application of efficient computational algorithms for the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs), with a particular focus on adaptive, multilevel and parallel algorithms and fluid dynamics applications. Much of this work is multidisciplinary, in collaboration with domain experts in fields as diverse as atmospheric chemistry, earth sciences, mechanical engineering and materials science.

Peter is currently the Director of the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Fluid Dynamics at Leeds, which has been funded to recruit over 100 PhD students between 2014 and 2023 inclusive. He has personally supervised 30 successful PhD students (with whom he has co-published almost 80 papers) and currently advises 5 others. In recent years he has published papers with international collaborators in Canada, China, France, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and USA.

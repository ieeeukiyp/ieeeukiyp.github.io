On 4th October 2016, over 60 guests celebrated the IEEE UK and Ireland
section IEEE Day celebrations. Held at the University of Westminster,
London, this event recognised the date in 1884 on which prominent
engineers and inventors of the time first gathered to share ideas and
inspiration and form what would later become the IEEE. The evening
attracted a diverse audience from many backgrounds, including students,
academics, industry representatives and IEEE members and volunteers.

Following opening announcements on the section's ambitions, plans and
services by the UK and Ireland Section Chair, guests enjoyed a series of
seminars including details on technical and career development
opportunities with the IEEE, \'History of Technology - why it is
important not to re-invent the Wheel', Mentoring opportunities for
younger members with the IEEE, and an introduction to chapters within
the section and the services available to students, young professionals
and women-in-engineering.

An awards ceremony followed, recognising the achievements of recent IEEE
fellows including Prof. Plamen Angelov of Lancaster University, Prof.
B.M. Azizur Rahman of City University London and Professor Lie-Laing
Yang of the University of Southampton. Section Outstanding Volunteer
awards were given to Veronika Nesheva, Noel Gomes and Dr. Lee
Crudgington for support of students and young professional members.

A networking drinks reception and panel discussion concluded the event,
with the celebration continuing into the evening with personal
networking and live music from Peyman Heydarian and the UCL IEEE Student
Society.

On behalf of the IEEE UK and Ireland section we would like to give our
sincere thanks to all all attendees who enjoyed the evening with us to
celebrate the occasion. We are planning more events across the UK and
Ireland so check the section website and social media for more details!

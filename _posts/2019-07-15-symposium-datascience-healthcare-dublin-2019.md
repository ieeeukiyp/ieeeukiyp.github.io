We were very fortunate to have support from **Think Biosolution**, **NDRC** and **The Digital Hub**, which was very helpful in organising and executing the event.

The primary audience consisted of Young professionals (IEEE members/non-members) who want to use IEEE as a channel for employment in data science in the Healthcare space.

This event was of particular interest to

• early-career professionals in the data science space
• healthcare professionals
• graduate students
• undergraduate seniors
• IT professionals looking to upskill or diversify
• Wannapreneurs in the healthcare space
• Researchers in health, data science, AI, ML, etc

The evening was opened with tea/coffee and networking, following which the event was MC'd by **_Koushik Kumar Nundy_**, CTO of Think Biosolution, and Dublin Representative of IEEE UK & Ireland Young Professionals.

Opening remarks were presented by the Hon. Ambassador of India to Ireland, **_Mr Sandeep Kumar_**.

This was followed by talks from an eclectic mix of academics, researchers, clinicians and administrators.

**_Eimear Galvin_** spoke about how data plays an important part in these healthcare startups and for HSE.

Eimear manages Health Innovation Hub Ireland (HIHI) in Dublin, based in St James hospital. HIHI is a joint government initiative of both the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DBEI) and the Department of Health (DoH), funded through Enterprise Ireland and supported by HSE. Part of Eimear’s role is to establish Ireland, through HIHI, as a leading location for start-ups and expanding healthcare companies, by allowing easy interaction with hospitals and primary care centres.

Following the talks, Eimear, Friedrich, Chandana and Soumyabrata were joined by Dr Shourjya Sanyal, CEO of Think Biosolution in a panel discussion about the role and significance of data in healthcare, especially clinical pathways and decision-making.

Each talk lasted 15 minutes, and the panel discussion was about 30 minutes long.

This was followed by a networking session with snacks. The event had over 110 registrations and we received a lot of positive feedback from the attendees.

The entire discussion could be summed by **Friedrich Wetterling**'s statement that

> "Data science in Healthcare is a white space in between medical devices, fitness monitoring platforms, and the pharmaceutical industry"

The YP Postgraduate STEM Research Symposium was a single day event that
gave the opportunity to early STEM researchers, especially PGRs (PhD and
MPhil), to present their research, receive feedback and explore the
possibilities of turning research to enterprise. The symposium was open
to professionals and students and accepted submissions of posters,
papers and research to enterprise pitches.

The inaugural symposium was organised by the IEEE UK & Ireland Young
Professionals and hosted by the Department of Computer Science,
University of Chester. During the day, the attendees (both IEEE and
non-IEEE members) participated in interactive workshops, paper & poster
presentations and an open-panel discussion. It was a great networking
opportunity for participants and young professionals.

The morning session of the event began with a talk on how researchers
are applying digital technologies to revive the history of Chester.
Thereafter, the keynote speaker of the Symposium (Prof Mike Hinchey,
Chair of IEEE UK & Ireland Section) gave a talk on ubiquitous use of
software in today's world that elicited several interactive discussions.

The morning session of the event concluded with paper presentations by
the first group of postgraduate STEM researchers. Attendees also engaged
other postgraduate STEM researchers during a poster presentation session
that held as participant helped themselves with lunch.

There was a poster session over lunch with participants actively
engaging with poster presenters who were keen to explain their work.

The afternoon session of the symposium began with concurrent workshop
sessions facilitated by experienced resourced persons from academia and
industry alike. The topics covered in the workshops included "Research
Methods and Tools" by Dr Shirley John, "Securing Funds and Publishing"
by Professor Nigel John, "Research to Enterprise" by Dr Cyril Onwubiko
and "Introduction to LaTeX" by Thomas Day.

A knowledge sharing open-panel discussion followed the workshop
sessions. The panellists comprise of a mix of young and experienced
professionals from industry and academia. Each panellist briefly
discussed and shared their experiences and perspectives related to their
career journeys and outlined focus area. Panellists also responded to
questions elicited from the audience in the interactive panel
discussion.

The panel discussion session resonated with participants. The focus
areas discussed include pathways to industry by Dr Patryk Kot, pathways
to academia by Dr Magomed Muradov, Professional Registration by Mike
Horne, benefits of professional body membership by Dr Cyril Onwubiko,
and starting an MPhil/PhD by Opeyemi Ajibola.

After a tea & coffee break, a second group of postgraduate STEM
researchers presented their papers (pictures 16-19) before the symposium
closed with awards ceremony for "Best Paper Presentation" and "Best
Poster Presentation" at the STEM Symposium. A post-symposium dinner
provided a further networking opportunity between symposium attendees,
speakers and the organising committee.

#### The Role of IEEE UK and Ireland Young Professionals (YP)

The Young Professionals Affinity Group was the main sponsor and
organiser of the event reinforcing its priority of helping Postgraduate
STEM Researchers to develop necessary research and presentation skills.
This symposium is one of such events that promotes interaction between
young professionals, postgraduate students/researchers, experienced
academia and industrial professionals to help the younger professionals
develop skills and strategies to excel in their research degrees and
future careers.

IEEE YP UK & Ireland will continue to deliver to the community of young
people with similar events, while building diverse professional
networks. Â The YP's effort was led by the Vice Chair, Dr Thaddeus Eze
with active support from the chair, Mr Noel Gomes and other YP
volunteers; Dr Keyur Joshi, and Mr Opeyemi Ajibola).

The YP were also supported by Dr Cyril Onwubiko IEEE UK & Ireland
Section Secretary who participated as a workshop facilitator and a
panellist and Prof Mike Hinchey Section Chair who gave the keynote talk.

#### The Impact of the Event

The feedback from the event attendees were encouraging. Some of the
participants hadn't heard about the IEEE and the IEEE YP affinity group
before and we seized the opportunity to introduce IEEE and its benefits
to a good number of them. We also received positive feedback and
suggestions from the speakers as well. We will reflect these feedback in
our next event.

With events like this, we are hoping that more enthusiasts will join our
team, as members and volunteers, to further our goals and commitment to
our members. We hope to continue the Postgraduate STEM Research
Symposium in the coming years in other parts of the Section.

#### Support

The event was approved and supported by the IEEE UK and Ireland Section
and IEEE YP Seed Funding was also secured for the event. The University
of Chester provided material support, including free venue and volunteer
staff. We would like to thank everyone who supported the event.

The [IEEE International Conference on Communications](https://icc2020.ieee-icc.org/) (ICC) is one of the IEEE
Communications Society's two flagship conferences dedicated to driving
innovation in nearly every aspect of communications. In 2020, due to
COVID-19, IEEE held its first-ever virtual ICC, originally scheduled to take
place in Dublin, Ireland.
Initially, the IEEE YP UK and Ireland representatives were in charge of
organising

- a session on Networks without borders, by [Linda Doyle](https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=LEDOYLE), Vice President for Research/Dean of Research in Trinity College Dublin
- a social event at Lansdowne Hotel, with local music by "The Irish House Party"

Courtesy COVID-19, the participation of the affinity group was juggled
to better serve the conference\'s needs.

On June 7, [Daniel Martins](https://tssg.org/staff/daniel-perez-martins/), YP\'s
South Ireland Representative, and [Koushik Kumar Nundy](http://kknundy.net/), YP\'s Dublin representative were
panelists in the **\"Volunteering for ComSoc\"** session, where they
shared their experience with volunteering for IEEE, and how it has
helped in both their professional growth, as well as the benefits it
provides to the IEEE and STEM community.

Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of
Singapore, outlining the various tenets of **\"Writing Research

#### How to give a Technical Presentation

Dr Razavi received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees (with honours) in Electrical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1998 and 2000, respectively. From August 1999 to June 2001, he was a member of research staff at Iran Telecommunications Research Centre, working on all-optical CDMA networks and the possible employment of optical amplifiers in such systems.  He joined the Research Laboratory of Electronics, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in 2001 to pursue his Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, which he completed in 2006. He continued his work at MIT as a Post-doctoral Associate during Fall 2006, before joining the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo as a Post-doctoral Fellow in January 2007. Since September 2009, he is a Faculty Member at the School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering at the University of Leeds.

Dr Razavi is a recipient of the MIT-HP Alliance Fellowship and the Marie-Curie International Reintegration Grant. He chaired and organized the first International Workshop on Quantum Communication Networks in 2014. He is the Coordinator of the European Innovative Training Network, QCALL, which aims at providing quantum communications services to all users. He is also a member of the National Hub for Quantum Communications Technologies in the UK and represents the University of Leeds at the Industry Specification Group on QKD in ETSI. Dr Razavi has authord an introductory book on quantum communications networks published as part of IOP Concise Physics series. His research interests include a variety of topics in quantum and classical optical communications, quantum cryptography, quantum optics, and quantum networks.

#### How to write research fellowship applications

Christoph Wälti is Professor of Bionanotechnology in the School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering. His research interests lie in molecular nanotechnology with particular focus on self-assembly applications and the interface between biology and semiconductors.

Christoph graduated from ETH Zürich, Switzerland, with an MSc in Physics in 1995 and received his PhD in 2000 from the Laboratory of Solid-State Physics of the same institution with a thesis on the study of the symmetry of the order parameter in the heavy-electron superconductor UBe13. In 2001 he was awarded a Swiss Marie-Curie Fellowship to work on the self-assembly of molecular complexes using DNA at the Cavendish Laboratory of the University of Cambridge.

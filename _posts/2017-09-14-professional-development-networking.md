The event began with sessions of career development talks facilitated by
resource persons. During these talks, participants were educated on
importance of developing competencies as ones' career transitions from
one phase to the next. Participants also received advice and tips on
managing their individual personality traits to achieve optimal
professional progression. A talk on personal brand development and
marketing emphasised the importance of building personal brands based on
personal inherent strengths and motivation. Participants were also
advised to work towards the convergence of how they want to be perceived
by others and how other perceive them. Strategies for effective
networking such as being a resource to others, staying in touch and
honest intentions were also discussed. Another talk on demonstration of
professionalism emphasised the importance of registering and identifying
with professional bodies and associations such as the IEEE. The
importance of continuous professional development during an individual's
career was also discussed. All talks proved to be very educative for
participants as each talk session was interactive allowing participants
to engage with the resource persons.

experienced professionals from academic, entrepreneurial and industry
backgrounds as panellists. This segment of the evening availed
participants the opportunity to ask questions and seek clarification on
professional development issues in their current careers and future
professions of interest. The segment was extremely interactive and
allowed young professionals to receive advice, feedbacks and views on
their queries from a wide range of experienced professionals.

The evening closed with a networking segment between young professionals
and experience panellists over light refreshments. The segment created
an interactive environment for participants to share ideas and views and
to get to know one another more.

# The Role of IEEE UK and Ireland Young Professionals (YP)

The YP affinity group organised this event because developing young
people's skills and helping them make progress with their career and
business ideas, with the help of events like this, is one of our
priorities as a group. The PDnet Evening promotes interaction between
young professionals and experienced professionals to help the younger
professionals develop skills and strategies to excel in their chosen
professions.

The YP continues to deliver to the community of young people with
similar events, while building diverse professional networks. We are
glad to make PDnet Evening happen in the UK for the first time along
with our co-host, IEEE PES Student Branch Chapter at the University of
Manchester. The YP's effort was led by the vice chair, Dr Thaddeus Eze
with active support from the YP UK & Ireland Midlands volunteers (Mr
Keyur Joshi, Dr Hatem Abbas and Mr Opeyemi Ajibola). All four
participated in the planning of the event and were also present at the
event. The YP were also supported by Iván Castro León (Chair, IEEE PES
UK&RI) who participated as a panellist in the open-panel discussion
during PDnet Evening.

# The Impact of the Event

The feedbacks from the event attendees were encouraging. Some of the
participants hadn't heard about the IEEE and the IEEE YP community
before and we seized the opportunity to introduce IEEE and its benefits
to a good number of them. One participant is set to register as a member
and has asked for information regarding organising IEEE supported
academic conferences. We believe that this event has further increased
the visibility of the IEEE and the Young Professionals affinity group.

The IEEE UK&RI Section funded this event and also helped in publicising
it on the Section's website.

With events like this, we are hoping that more enthusiasts will join our
team, as members and volunteers to further our goals and commitment to
our members. We hope to continue PDnet in the coming years in other
parts of the Section. Check

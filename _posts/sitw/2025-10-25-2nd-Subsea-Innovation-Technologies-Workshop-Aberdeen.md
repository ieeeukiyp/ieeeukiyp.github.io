The 2nd IEEE Subsea Innovation Technologies Workshop will be held in Aberdeen, Scotland, between 23rd and 24th January, 2026. 

IEEE UK & Ireland (UK&I) Young Professionals is collaborating with IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society to organise this workshop.

## Workshop Features
**The event focuses on keynote, panel discussion, workshop, research presentations, awards, and a networking event with Industry participation.**

* **Keynote and Workshop:** Learn from notable experts as they deliver keynote talks on various subsea technologies topics.

* **Presentations:** Participants are invited to submit abstracts of their research for oral presentation at the workshop. The submissions will be classified and presented through different tracks. This is not a peer reviewed conference and full paper submission is not required â€“ the idea here is to give participants the opportunity to meet other experts and discuss the work.

which recently concluded in Glasgow, witnessed active participation from
around 75 students, academics, entrepreneurs and professionals attending

The event kicked off with a visit to the Power Networks Demonstration
Centre, followed by a joint reception with HISTELCON -- Region 8's
flagship conference on History and Electrotechnology to provide cross
collaboration and mutual networking opportunities. This was followed by
the official WESYP 2019 opening ceremony and dinner addressed by the

Priestley (Chief Marketing Officer, WFS Technologies Ltd.) on 'Emerging
Trends for the Next Decade and Beyond'. There were 2 sub-plenaries

systems, digital technologies as well as global sustainability. The
sub-plenaries were delivered by eminent academics from the University of

as well as by the IET Young Women Engineer of the Year 2018 awardee, Ms.
Lorna Bennet. This was followed by an insightful workshop on

to share information on the entity they represented. During the last

This is a short event organised by the YP UK and Ireland to present
basic Arduino concepts to the young professionals, to get them started
with the programming and prototyping of electronic systems. The Arduino
is an open, cheap and flexible microcontroller platform that simplifies
the use of electronic systems and can be applied from homemade to
professional projects designed by hobbyists and companies. This will be
a 2-hours hands-on event, where the attendants will be able to create
simple codes to automate their own electronic projects.

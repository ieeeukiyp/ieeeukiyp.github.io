The IEEE Young Entrepreneurs Open Day 2017 Dublin was the first event of
the IEEE UK&Ireland Young Professionals Group in Ireland, and focused in
supporting and preparing the students and Young Professionals for facing
a challenging world with less work opportunities and a urgent need of
continuous professional development.

This event was held on 25 February 2017 in University College Dublin in
Dublin, Ireland and had a good turnout with about 70 attendees, speakers
and volunteers. The event was a good opportunity to network, share
experiences and to know more about all the tools available and agencies
in Ireland that can support the Young Entrepreneurs to start or grow
their business.

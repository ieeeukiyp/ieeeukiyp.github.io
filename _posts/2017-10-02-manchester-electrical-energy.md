MEEPS (Manchester Energy and Electrical Power Systems) is the biggest
yearly workshop organised by The IEEE Student Branch Power and Energy
(PES) Chapter at the University of Manchester. This year, the workshop
which is titled "Big Data Applications in Power Systems" was held from
09:00 -- 17:00 on **3rd November, 2017** in  a new home at the
Manchester Conference Centre, Sackville Street, Manchester, M1 3BB.

## YP Involvement

This year's MEEPS was organised in collaboration with the IEEE UK &
Ireland Young Professionals. The YP also sponsored a £100 prize award to
recognise research with the most potential to be converted into a
product. Seven participants submitted abstracts on how their research
can be adopted by industry (i.e., how their research can be made into a
product and/or how industry can improve industry practice given
information from their research).

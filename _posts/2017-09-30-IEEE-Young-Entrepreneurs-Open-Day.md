# Event summary of IEEE Young Entrepreneurs Open Day, Edinburgh,UK 2017

Welcome to the IEEE Young Entrepreneurs Open Day 2017!

On behalf of the IEEE UK and Ireland Section, we are pleased to invite you to the ​second​ of a series of seminars across the country that will focus on developing the professional skills of young engineering students and graduates

Over the past forty years, rising numbers of workforce in the global economy have been denied access to secure and decently paid work with reasonable prospects. On average one fifth of those currently employed or self-employed do not think their jobs are secure. This even applies to those in middle income and higher paid roles. The students and young professionals face a challenging world with less opportunities and tough entry into the world of work, employment and professional development. This event focuses on the role that the UK & Ireland Section of IEEE can play in supporting and preparing the students and Young Professionals for facing the emerging systemic challenges. The event is intended as a response to the Institution’s corporate social responsibility within the UK & Ireland and in collaboration/partnership with public and private enterprises in the Section.

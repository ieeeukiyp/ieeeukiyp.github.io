# Symposium Features

The event focuses on research presentations, posters, keynote, panel discussion, workshop, awards, and a networking event with Industry participation.

# Keynote and workshop:

Learn from notable experts as they deliver keynote talks on various STEM topics.The symposium will also offers workshops on a range of topics.

# Presentations

Participants are invited to submit abstracts of their research for oral/poster presentation at the symposium. The submissions will be classified and presented through different tracks. This is not a peer reviewed conference and full paper submission is not required -- the idea here is to give participants the opportunity to discuss their research before an unfamiliar audience and get feedback which will help them improve their work for subsequent presentations. A poster session will allow participants to interact with different researchers on their displayed research topics.

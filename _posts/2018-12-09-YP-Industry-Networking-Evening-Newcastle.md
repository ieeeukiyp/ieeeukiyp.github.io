The IEEE YP Networking Evening was a meetup event organised by the IEEE
UK and Ireland Young Professionals group and focused on the sharing of
knowledge and experiences between young people (especially students,
recent graduates and young professionals) and industry personnel.

The event was held on 9th December 2018 in Northumbria University,
Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, where around 20 attendees, including young
professionals and students (members and non-members), had the
opportunity to listen to two talks and share experiences with each other
and speakers. This event was an excellent opportunity to network and
share experiences with other IEEE volunteers and like-minded people.

The event programme included one presentation from the Academy (Dr.
Khalid Hashim - Get it Published in a Quality Journal) and one from the
Industry (Dr. Rishad Shafik - Designing Electronics for an Energy-Smart
Future). These talks set the mood for the lively discussions and
networking that followed them.

This event also served as an excellent opportunity to increase IEEE and Northumbria University Student Branch's visibility amongst young professionals and its outreach to existing students in Newcastle upon Tyne. Along with this, graduating members were also able to understand the benefits of IEEE Young Professionals membership and how they could use it as a tool to advance their career.

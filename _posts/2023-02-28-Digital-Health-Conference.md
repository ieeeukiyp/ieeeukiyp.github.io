In recent years, the ICT field has devoted efforts to provide novel solutions in the health space. It is expected in the near future that digital devices, such as smartwatches, will have their functionalities further enhanced to collect more health-related data to support the monitoring and diagnostics of a wide range of human diseases (e.g. Alzheimer and heart problems). To better discuss this future and its implications, the YP UK and Ireland will promote the Digital Health Conference. This is a full-day conference with experts from ICT and Health Sciences fields in Ireland who will share their knowledge about Digital Health, to an audience of young professionals (IEEE and non-IEEE members). This event is also an opportunity to meet like-minded people and learn about the most recent developments in this field, through the point-of-view of academics, industrial and bureaucratic leaders.

The full programme will be announced around mid-October.

Date: Summer 2023.
